Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.

I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem. get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called &quot;paprika hendl,&quot; and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians."/>
